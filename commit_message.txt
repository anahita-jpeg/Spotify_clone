refactor: Improve HTML structure and externalize CSS

This commit refactors the Spotify clone's frontend for better maintainability and web best practices:

- **`Spotify_clone.html`:**
    - Moved all inline CSS to a new external `style.css` file.
    - Added essential `meta` tags for character set, viewport, and description.
    - Refactored HTML to use more semantic tags (`<aside>`, `<main>`, `<section>`).
    - Ensured all `<img>` tags have descriptive `alt` attributes.
    - Consolidated redundant CSS classes (e.g., `box_1` to `box`, `bb_1` to `card`, `biz_box1` to `biz-card`).
- **`style.css` (New File):**
    - Contains all the CSS previously embedded in the HTML.
    - Updated CSS rules to reflect the consolidated class names.
